# Mad-Libs Generator

A beginner-friendly Python Mad Libs generator that creates a funny vacation story using user input and string concatenation.

This project was created as a learning exercise in basic Python syntax, user interaction, and terminal output.

## What I Learned
* How to use `input()` to get words from the user  
* How to store values in variables  
* How to use string concatenation to build a story  
* How to provide clear instructions and word examples  
* How to print multi-line output in a readable format  

## Important Note
